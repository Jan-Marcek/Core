	<h1>Intlib documentation</h1>
	This section describe how to build DPU's project. First of all we give
	few words about used technologies like Maven and OSGI. After that the
	build process for DPU's project will be described. And nearle at the
	end we mention how to get information about dependencies from the
	jar-file and what can be done to resolve them.

	<h2>Maven</h2>

	<h3>Maven project</h3>

	<h3>pom.xml</h3>
	Contains Maven related project' settings. If you want to add dependency
	to the project this is the right place. Example of pom.xml file is
	attached to the sample DPU.

	<h2>OSGI technology</h2>
	OSGI support dynamic loadings of jar files with their dependency resolving.
	In OSGI terminology jar files are called bundles. Each bundle contains
	<b>maninifest.mf</b> file. This files contains bundle description. <br/>
	 
	Dependencies are resolved base on import/export package specification in 
	manifest.mf. The sample of such specification can be seen bellow:  
<div class="maven-pom"> <pre> <code>
Export-Package: cz.cuni.mff.xrg.intlib.loader.rdf
Import-Package: com.vaadin.data,com.vaadin.data.util,com.vaadin.server,c
 om.vaadin.shared.ui.combobox,com.vaadin.ui,cz.cuni.xrg.intlib.commons.c
 onfiguration;version="0.0.1",cz.cuni.xrg.intlib.commons.data;version="0
 .0.1",cz.cuni.xrg.intlib.commons.loader;version="0.0.1",cz.cuni.xrg.int
 lib.commons.module.data;version="0.0.1",cz.cuni.xrg.intlib.commons.modu
 le.dialog;version="0.0.1",cz.cuni.xrg.intlib.commons.module.dpu;version
 ="0.0.1",cz.cuni.xrg.intlib.commons.web;version="0.0.1",cz.cuni.xrg.int
 lib.rdf.enums,cz.cuni.xrg.intlib.rdf.exceptions,cz.cuni.xrg.intlib.rdf.
 interfaces
</code> </pre> </div>
	The Export-Package specify packages that bundle provide. On the other hand 
	Import-Package list the packages that are required. <br/>	
	Before bundle or it's content (class) can be used in application, bundle 
	must be resolved. Bundle can be resolved only if all packages in 
	Import-Package are provided (exported) by other bundles or by 
	the host application (environment).

	<h2>Building  DPU project</h2>
	DPU's projects are using maven so to build project use maven command with 
	install target.
<div class="maven-cmd">mvn install</div>	
	This will create the OSGI bundle that will contain compiled code from
	respective project as well as direct dependencies with <b>compile</b> scope.
	
	<span class="warn">Do not use environment to create jar file without
	Maven. This may result into jar file that may not work properly
	or may even not be an OSGI bundle.</span>
		
		
	<h3>MANIFEST.MF</h3>
	Manifest file can be found:
	<ul>
		<li>After mnv install in project\target\classes\META-INF</li>
		<li>In jar file \META-INF. To acces file in jar file, change the
		extension from jar to zip and then use your favorite program to unizip 
		it. </li> 
	</ul>
	The MANIFEST.MF file contains bundle description. Here you can check 
	bundle dependencies ie. Import-package. <br/>
	Manifest file should also contains line with <b>DPU-MainClass</b> and
	<b>DPU-Package</b> that are essential for bundle usage in Intlib project.
	
	<h3>Dependencies</h3>
	Each bundle specify it's dependencies in temrs of packages rather then jar
	files or libraries. When building tha DPU project the dependecies specified 
	in pom.xml with compile scope are automaticaly added to the output bundle 
	file.However the transitive dependecies are not embeded. Instead of this the 
	used packages from those transitive dependencies are listed in 
	Package-Import. <br/> There are two ways how to solve this problem:
	<ol>
		<li>Add transitive dependency into pom.xml</li>
		<li>Create bundle that would be loaded asi library and would 
		export required packages.</li>
	</ol>
	For the second approach it may be importat to mention, that you can use 
	more bundles which together give all the required packages. But keep in 
	mind that the library bundles can also have dependencies ie. 
	Import-Packages. These must be also satisfied othervised the library 
	bundle can not be used.
