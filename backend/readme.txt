Backend requires loading configuration from properties configuration file.
Sample configuration file is located in /conf/config.properties in the root of
the project. Configuration is to be stored in $HOME/.intlib/config.properties.

The path to the configuration file can be set by program parameter
-c path_to_config.properties. This is obviously unachievable for frontend
web application, where the default path must be used.
